# register-file
in this file i made a register file having four registers . each register is of 64 bits i.e [63:0].
the address is same for both read and write .
first of all i wirte four random values  in register 0 - register 3.
then read these values from register in consecutuive cycles.
then do some wait and  write another four random values to registers and read it from the registers with gap of two cycles each.
